I create a videogame where you will test your reflexes and reaction time. The game consists of measuring the time it takes you to press a button once a timer has started.



Game 3: Test your reflexes
In this game you will test your reflexes and reaction time.
The game consists of measuring the time it takes you to press a button once a timer has started.
Phase 1
The game will have a “Start Game” button that, once pressed, will display a message on the screen with the text of “Get ready...” for a random amount of seconds (from 0 to 10 seconds) and then it displays a “Stop game” button that you will have to press as quickly as you can to measure the time it takes you to press the button, this way you can measure your reaction time.
Once the “Get ready…” message disappears and the “Stop Game” button appears, you will have to start a timer using JavaScript dates to measure the time between the moment the “Stop Game” button has been displayed on the screen and the moment the “Stop Game” button is clicked to stop the game. 
Once the button is clicked, you will have to stop the time counter and display the amount of seconds it took you to press the button to display the time on the screen and in the right hand panel with the username and the time it took the user to press the “Stop Game” button.
